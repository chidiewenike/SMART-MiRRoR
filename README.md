# SMART MiRRoR
Currently designing my own personal smart mirror. I have designed the mirror itself with the desired hardware installed. I designed the GUI from scratch using Tkinter. It currently contains modules that have the time, date, my schedule, to-do list, news, inspirational quote, word of the day, weather forecast, upcoming matches for my favorite soccer teams, and unread emails (not shown). I utilized Google GSuite to link my calendar, to-do list, and email. I used Google Firebase to store match information about my teams. I also used DarkSky API for the weather, Word of the Day API for word of the day, a quote json for the inspirational quote, and a news API for the news. I am currently implementing facial recognition for an alarm and room monitoring as well as a custom-made voice assistant to play music, sleep my mirror, and more.
